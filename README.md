# rl-nanodegree-agent-unity-banana

in these repo  we use DQN  to train an agent within unity env to learn how to navigate  and get the right banana color
the DQN  is a Deep Neural network that get as input the env state   and give as an action we  use the max to choice the the max action value   
he project environment is similar to, but not identical to the Banana Collector environment on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page. 

farther impovment can be done by impleent double   DQN 

for ore inofrmation about DQN  please read these  paper https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf
